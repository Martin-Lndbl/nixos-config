# Nixos System Configuration

My system configuration in one place.

Currently I am using 
* [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) as tilting manager
* [Eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) for my status bar etc.
* [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) as editor.

## Highlights
Setting the nix-colors colorscheme changes the whole operating system, including neovim and bash.
