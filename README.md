# Nixos System Configuration

Organize your nixos system config and standalone home-manager in one repository.

## Capabilities
* Configure multiple users 
* Set up configurations for different hosts / machines
* Synchronize your home-manager configuration between different machines
* Quickly change your window- / display-manager

NOTE: Since this is also my personal configuration you need to expect breaking changes. I don't recommend forking this repository but rather use it as a starting point if you are relatively new to Nix.

This is not an universal module for setting up multiple machines with an synchronized home-manager configuration, but my way of solving this problem. For more complex solutions I recommend checking out these guys:
